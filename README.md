# DeepLearning_cryptography_DRDO
This repository contains the code of the project named "Deep learning based Differential Distinguisher for lightweight cipher GIFT-COFB". The whole work is done on Google colab, so it can be run on any local computer with proper internet connection and proper use of library function. The dataset is generated randomly through the code. Datasets are created individually for each model ie. wang+bakshi, wang+our, random+our, random+bakshi. Inputs are of two type wang's differential input and random differential input. At first the GIFT-COFB encryption has been implemented. Then the input differentials are generated. After that we have created our model using different types of input differentials.Our model is based on the bakshi's recommended Deep learning model which use deep neural networks.

Requirement: To run this code one may use jupyter notebook or google colab and the corresponding library functions and frameworks lincluding pytorch and tensors.

This research work is done as our summer internship program at DRDO. The collaborators of this research work are Reshma Rajan, Rupam Kumar Roy, Diptakshi Sen,Girish Mishra.
